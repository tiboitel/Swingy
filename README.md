- Set the run button usable.
- Need to  save and load player. Use the CharacterCreationController and the LoadUI.
- Need to use an observer pattern between the view and the player.
- Same for SquareMap.
- Need to setup Interface for rendering interface. So we can switch between interface instead of class for CLI / GUI.
- Set basic game Logic on the GameController. Need to have an even comportement with GUI and CLI. Have fun at the box.
